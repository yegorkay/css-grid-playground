# CSS Grid Playground

CSS Grid Playground allows you to play with each individual grid property in order to understand what each property does in the layout. 

*insert some gif demo here*

Simply edit the value in an editor, and see the corresponding grid change instantaneously. Properties are split up into `Parent Properties` and `Child Properties`.

## But Why?

CSS Grid allows a developer to create complex layouts with ease. It allows for simpler markup and more flexibility in arranging your layout if things ever need to change. 

I created this tool because I wanted to learn more about CSS Grid and how powerful it is. I wanted a tool that would instantly show me a visual change without much hassle, while most importantly teaching me the concepts of CSS Grid. It has helped me understand what CSS Grid does and I hope it helps you too in learning one of the most powerful features of CSS.
